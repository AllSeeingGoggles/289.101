            <p>Amanda Kim is an emerging writer with a passion for strange, unique, and comedic stories. Her style has been influenced by many sources over the years, such as Monty Python, Roald Dahl, Chowder, Miyazaki films, and Yo-kai Watch (look it up).</p><!--Take out the influences?-->
            <p>Amanda feels like much of the pop media landscape has been leaning further and further towards serious, depressing subjects and styles. While she has no problem with that inherently, she wishes to inject some more joy and humour into the mix. Without fun, whatâ€™s the point?</p>
            <p>On top of that, she favours down-to-earth stakes, and would much rather explore the ways people interact with each other and their world than write yet another story about saving the planet from destruction.</p>
